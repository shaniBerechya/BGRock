Project Overview
This project is a Java-based concurrent system simulating the perception and mapping of a robotic vacuum cleaner, the GurionRock Pro Max Ultra Over 9000. It integrates camera, LiDAR, GPS, and IMU sensors to construct a real-time map using a custom microservices framework with asynchronous event handling.

Required Skills & Knowledge
âœ” Java Concurrency â€“ Threads, synchronization, and shared resource management.
âœ” Microservices & Event-Driven Architecture â€“ Independent services communicating via message passing.
âœ” Future & Callback Mechanisms â€“ Handling asynchronous computations.
âœ” SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) â€“ Sensor fusion for real-time mapping.
âœ” Maven & Unit Testing â€“ Dependency management and JUnit-based TDD.
Theoretical Concepts Used
ðŸ“Œ Parallel Processing â€“ Multi-threaded task distribution with a round-robin mechanism.
ðŸ“Œ Robotics Perception â€“ Processing sensor data to build a coherent map.
ðŸ“Œ Message-Based Communication â€“ Events and broadcasts for inter-service communication.
ðŸ“Œ Future & Promise Pattern â€“ Asynchronous computation resolution.
ðŸ“Œ Fault Tolerance â€“ Handling sensor failures and crashes gracefully.
This project demonstrates efficient concurrent programming in Java, emphasizing real-time sensor integration and multi-threaded processing.
